# Easier JavaScript Apps with AngularJS

To get this running you need a few things installed:
 - NodeJS (nodejs.org)
 - NPM (comes with Node)
 - MongoDB (mongodb.org)

Use your command line to enter the main directory (above this one)
and run `npm install`. This will install express and mongoose, and
their dependencies.

Before running it, make sure MongoDB is running.

Then run `node server/server.js`, and point your browser
at http://localhost:9000/
